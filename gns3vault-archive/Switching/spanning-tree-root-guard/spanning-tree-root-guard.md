## Scenario

**For this lab you need REAL hardware. You can't use switches in GNS3!**

**You need at least Catalyst 2950 switches for this lab.**

Medieval corporation is specialized in enhancing security for switched networks. You as one of the network engineers in the security team are working on a switched network of one of your customers. You want to enhance security by making sure the network will not accept any inferior root bridges.

## Goal

- Configure SW2 as the root bridge for VLAN 1.
