# Flex Links Backup Interface

![Network Topology](./topology-flex-links-backup-interface.png)

## Scenario:

**For this lab you need REAL hardware. You can't use switches in GNS3!**

**You need at least Catalyst 2950 switches for this lab.**

The network agency corporation has hired you as a spanning tree specialist. One of their customers has issues with a switched network that only has fiber connections. Every now and then there's a problem with the fiber and as a result layer 2 loops occur. It will take two months for the fiber company to check all cables/connectors so you want a temporary solution...

## Goal:

* Configure SW3 so the fa0/14 interface is the active interface. fa0/16 should be the backup interface.
* Whenever interface fa0/14 on SW3 fails the fa0/16 interface should take over.

## IOS:

Basic IOS for the switches should be sufficient. No special features needed.

## Topology:

**You need to register to download the GNS3 Topology File. (Registration is Free!)**
