# Basic Frame-Relay Switch

![Network Topology](./topology-basic-frame-relay-switch.jpg)

## Scenario

You are working for a huge international car company as the senior network engineer. Recently the Frame-relay switch of one of your WAN links died and you decided to replace it with a Cisco Router.

## Goal:

- Take a good look at the topology before you start configuring.
- The blue/red lines are PVC's (Permanent Virtual Circuit).
- DLCI numbers are shown on the topology picture.
- Enable frame-relay switching on Router Bumblebee.
- Configure the correct PVC's.
- Using the 'show frame-relay route' command on Router Bumblebee should show both PVC's as 'active'.
- Using the 'show frame-relay map' command on Router Optimus or Ironhide should show both PVC's as active.
- Optional: Try to achieve the same result without using the 'frame-relay route' command.
