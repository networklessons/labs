# Frame Relay Static Mapping

## Scenario

Jack and Emma are using an old frame-relay switch to connect their routers. Unfortunately they are unable to get any connection. Think you can help them out?

## Goal

* All IP addresses have been preconfigured for you.
* Disable frame relay inverse ARP.
* Configure frame relay mappings so the routers can ping each other.
* Frame relay should support broadcast emulation.
