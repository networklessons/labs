# Frame Relay Inverse ARP

## Scenario

Jack and Emma are using an old frame-relay switch to connect their routers. Unfortunately they are unable to get any connection. Think you can help them out?

## Goal

- All IP addresses have been preconfigured for you.
- Configure both routers so the frame-relay mappings are learned automatically.
- Frame-relay should support broadcast emulation.

## IOS

- c3640-jk9s-mz.124-16.bin
