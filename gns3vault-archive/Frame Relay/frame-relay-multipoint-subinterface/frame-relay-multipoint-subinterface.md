# Frame Relay Multipoint Subinterface

## Scenario

Most toons from the fairy tale forest have switched their career to become network engineers. Cinderella has been trying to reach Hansel and Gretel through the frame relay network but hasn't had any luck. Think you can take this dance?

## Goal

- Configure all routers to use frame-relay encapsulation.
- Configure the IP addresses as specified in the topology picture on point-to-multipoint subinterfaces.
- Ensure you can ping both routers from router Cinderella.
- Disable frame relay inverse ARP and make sure to configure the correct frame relay mappings.
- Ensure the frame relay network has broadcast capabilities.
- Ensure you can still ping both routers from router Cinderella.
