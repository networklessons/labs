# OSPF Flood Reduction

![Network Topology](./topology-ospf-flood-reduction.png)

## Scenario:

You live on a tropical island and work as a network engineer and scientist. After years of study you have discovered a formula so you do not age anymore. Unfortunately your network is running OSPF and LSAs still age...you are wondering if you can do something to OSPF as well.

## Goal:

* All IP addresses have been preconfigured for you.
* Configure OSPF on all routers. Achieve both connectivity.
* Configure OSPF so there is no longer a periodic refresh of LSAs.
