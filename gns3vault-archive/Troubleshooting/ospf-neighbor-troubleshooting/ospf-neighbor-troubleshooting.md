# OSPF Neighbor Troubleshooting

## Scenario

The hotel agency has had several network engineers trying to configure OSPF for them. As a result the whole network is one big mess and they decide to hire you to fix their problems. There are two OSPF areas and all routers are running OSPF. Unfortunately all OSPF neighbor adjacencies are broken...you feel like you are standing on a ledge but you should be able to fix this!

## Goal

* All IP addresses have been preconfigured for you.
* OSPF is preconfigured with the areas as specified in the topology picture.
* **Do not use show run**! (this will spoil the fun :) use the appropriate 'show' and 'debug' commands. This will teach you the skills needed to become a true troubleshooting master.
* Your goal is simple: Make sure all OSPF neighbor adjacencies are working!
