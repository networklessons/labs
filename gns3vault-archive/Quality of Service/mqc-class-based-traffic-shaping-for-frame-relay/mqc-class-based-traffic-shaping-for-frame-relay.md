# MQC Class-Based Traffic Shaping for Frame-Relay

## Scenario

You work for a large provider in India as a senior network engineer specialized in Quality of Service. All the customers of the service provider have an Ethernet connection which is capable of delivering speeds up to 10Mbps. The ISP has different subscriptions and you need to enforce that customers only get what they are paying for...time to get in shape!

## Goal

- All IP addresses have been preconfigured for you.
- Configure router Kos so telnet traffic for the PVC with DLCI 102 is shaped to an average of 128Kbps.
- Configure router Quall so http traffic for the PVC with DLCI 201 is shaped to a peak rate of 64Kbps.
