# MQC Frame-Relay FRF.12 Fragmentation

## Scenario

As one of the network engineers for a large frame-relay provider in the US you are asked by your boss to configure QoS. Some of the larger frames should be fragmented to prepare for a future VoIP configuration.

## Goal

- All IP addresses have been preconfigured for you.
- Configure the network so all traffic sent down the frame relay link is fragmented to 200 bytes using FRF.12 fragmentation.
