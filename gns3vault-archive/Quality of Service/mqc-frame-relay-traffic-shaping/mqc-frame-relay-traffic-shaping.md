# MQC Frame-Relay Traffic Shaping

## Scenario

As one of the network engineers for a large frame-relay provider in the US you are asked by your boss to configure QoS. He wants you to get in shape by configuring traffic shaping for frame-relay. You are familiar with the old legacy solution but you need to use MQC for this one.

## Goal

- All IP addresses have been preconfigured for you.
- Configure router Kos so all traffic passing the frame-relay link has a CIR of 64Kbps.
- You are not allowed to enable frame-relay shaping on the physical interface.
