# Kron Task Scheduler

## Scenario

You want to make sure your router automatically saves its configuration every day. You are familiar with Cron for Linux and you just heard from a colleague that there is a similar feature for Cisco routers. Kron time!

## Goal

* All IP addresses have been preconfigured for you.
* Configure router Kron so it saves the running-config every Saturday at 20:00.
