# Policy Based Routing Traffic Filtering

## Scenario

As part of the security team you are always looking for ways to improve security within the company. You want to get rid of all the local vty/console logins within your network so you decide to implement some AAA security.

## Goal

- All IP addresses have been configured for you, look at the topology picture for the IP addresses.
- OSPF has been preconfigured for you on all routers.
- Configure router Mirror so all ICMP traffic from network 3.3.3.0 /24 larger than 150 bytes will be dropped.
- You are not allowed to apply any access-list on the interfaces.
