# Reflexive Access-List

## Scenario

As part of the security team you are always looking for ways to improve security within the company. You want to get rid of all the local vty/console logins within your network so you decide to implement some AAA security.

## Goal

- All IP addresses have been configured for you, look at the topology picture for the IP addresses.
- OSPF has been preconfigured for full connectivity.
- Configure router Mirror so ICMP and TCP traffic from network 1.1.1.0 /24 is allowed.
- Configure router Mirror with an inbound access-list on the FastEthernet1/0 interface so return traffic is allowed. You are not allowed to create specific entries.
