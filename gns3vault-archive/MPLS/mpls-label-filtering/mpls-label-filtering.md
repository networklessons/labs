# MPLS Label Filtering

![Network Topology](./topology-mpls-label-filtering.jpg)

## Scenario

Your MPLS Backbone works like a charm but your security officer still has some issues. He doesn't like that some of the prefixes are advertised with a label and it's up to you to fix it....bring on the sticker remover!

## Goal

* All IP addresses on the customer routers have been preconfigured for you.
* OSPF has been configured on all routers and all networks are advertised.
* Configure MPLS on all routers, ensure all prefixes are advertised with a label.
* The prefixes on the loopback interfaces should NOT be advertised with a label.
