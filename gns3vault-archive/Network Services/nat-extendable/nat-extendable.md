# NAT Extendable

## Scenario

Your NAT configuration seems to work fine but you need to create a couple of static entries so one of your internal hosts is reachable using multiple IP addresses. Let's see what you can do!

## Goal

- All IP addresses have been preconfigured for you.
- Configure NAT on router NAT so router Jack is reachable as IP address 192.168.23.20 and 192.168.23.21 from router Tomb.
