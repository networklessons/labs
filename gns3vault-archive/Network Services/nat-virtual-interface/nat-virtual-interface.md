# NAT Virtual Interface

## Scenario

After passing the CCNA exam you feel like you could do anything with NAT. You just started at a new job as a junior network engineer but to your surprise the router you are working on doesn't have any "inside" or "outside" commands. It does create a NVI interface but you have no idea what it is...let's see if you can configure NAT anyway...

## Goal

* All IP addresses have been preconfigured for you.
* Configure NAT so hosts on network 192.168.12.0 /24 are translated to network 192.168.23.0 /24.
* You are not allowed to use the "ip nat inside" or "ip nat outside" command.
