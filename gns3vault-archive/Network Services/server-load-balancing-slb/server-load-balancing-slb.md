![Network Topology](./topology-server-load-balancing-slb.png)

## Scenario:

You are the senior network engineer for a large online webshop called "Booky Wooky". One of your load balancers recently failed and you don't have any replacement...business hasn't been so good since the ereaders have been launched a few years ago. You decide to take a spare router and configure it for load balancing...

## Goal:

* All IP addresses have been preconfigured for you.
* Configure router SLB so it spreads connections to the webserver in a round-robin fashion to router WWW1 and WWW2.
* Configure router SLB so WWW1 gets twice as many connections as WWW2.
